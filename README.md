# Network Programming

## Description

This repository contains my Network Programming (2024) subject tasks at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember. In this subject, I learned about network programming with the implementation conducted using Python. We started from the basics of Python to be able to program using socket and protocols such as HTTP and FTP.
